#Remark:
#1. This configuration only supports applying for ordinary TLS certificates. If you want to apply for a wildcard TLS certificate, please refer to the corresponding introduction and corresponding configuration examples in 'Caddy (Other Configuration) (Caddy's special application configuration method.)'.
#2. This example uses a non-AES algorithm cipher suite configuration to avoid being blocked.
